# Next + Netlify Markdown Blog

## The nitty gritty

If you'd like to work with this project locally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you'd like to write a new blog post, write it in Markdown in the `posts` directory.

### Installation options

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/lokeshreddy007/next-netlify-blog`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm run dev`

### Styling

Included are some basic styles with [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), which is included out of the box with Next.js. Because this uses Next.js 9.3, there's also built-in Sass support and CSS Module support, if you'd prefer to use those.

The font used is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).

### Hero images

You may include an optional hero image in your posts. Put the images in `public/static/`, and then include in your blog .md file like so:

```
---
title: 'Post title'
author: 'Post author'
date: '2020-06-21'
hero_image: ../static/example.jpg
---
```

See `Posts` folder for an example of this.
